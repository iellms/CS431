# CS431
Here is the public repository for our room temperature data for our CS431 project.


## Methods
We used a network of Raspberry Pi 3s and TMP117 sensors to record the temperature of our dorm rooms at Colby College.

## Motivations
My room is extremely cold all the time, but sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night sweating profusely because I am too hot.  Many other students at Colby have experienced similar problems and we believe that being uncomfortable in your own bed can lead to a decrease in academic perfomance.  Thus, we aim to quantify the amount of temperature fluctuation in rooms and to see when they are outside an acceptible range (68-75 degrees F).

## Structure
In the data folder, there will be 3 files.  The first is `calibration.csv`, which is what we used to help calibrate sensors and design our visulaization on ObservableHQ.  The others are `AAPT131C.csv` and `EAST133.csv` which are used for storing the temperature data from our personal rooms.

## Visualization
Using ObservableHQ's Observable Plot, we have made some preliminary visualizations that can be found at https://observablehq.com/@iellms/cs431-project-matthew-marring-and-ian-ellmer (Note: at this time this can only be viewed properly in Chrome desktop, we will troubleshoot why it may not be working on mobile then give an update when it is up and running on mobile).
