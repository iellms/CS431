# CS431
Here is the public repository for our room temperature data for our CS431 project.


## Methods
We used a network of Raspberry Pi 3s and TMP117 sensors to record the temperature of our dorm rooms at Colby College.

## Motivations
My room is extremely cold all the time, but sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night sweating profusely because I am too hot.  Many other students at Colby have experienced similar problems and we believe that being uncomfortable in your own bed can lead to a decrease in academic perfomance.  Thus, we aim to quantify the amount of temperature fluctuation in rooms and to see when they are outside an acceptible range (68-75 degrees F).
